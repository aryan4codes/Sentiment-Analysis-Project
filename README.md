# Sentiment-Analysis
In this NLP project, I developed an automated system to analyze text content and perform sentiment analysis. The project involved web scraping articles from various URLs and extracting relevant information using Python libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup.

Create a folder and download all files and save it in the folder.
Run the 'Sentiment Analysis.py' python file in any IDE of your choice and run the code.
